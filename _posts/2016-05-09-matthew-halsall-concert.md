Manchunian trumpeter, composer and band-leader Matthew Halsall has established himself as one of the most prominent names in the contemporary European Jazz scene. Matthew's ever progressing musical knowledge and diversity takes the listener on a journey that is rarely obtained by artists of any genre.

Featuring The Gondwana Orchestra's unbelievable line-up comprising of Luke Flowers of Cinematic Orchestra (Drums), Rachael Gladwin (harp), Jordan Smart (saxophones), Taz Modi (piano) and Gavin Barras (double bass), it's likely that there could be treats from other friends of the Gondwana label as well.

Matthew and The Gondwana Orchestra****will be playing brand new content from their critically acclaimed album 'Into Forever'****released in September of this year as well as more well known sounds from their iTunes Album of the year 2014, 'When the world was one'
